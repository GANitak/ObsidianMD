At $job[-1] we used Splunk for a bunch of stuff, but costs were around $50k/yr in licensing (plus ~$10k every 3-5 years for hardware) for the log volume we handled there. Funded due to need to meet specific security requirements, but also used for ops stuff.
Basic Splunk summary: it's awesome but expensive.
