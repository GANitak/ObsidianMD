// An **Aurae cell** is a name given to Linux control groups (**cgroups**) that also
// includes a name, and special pre-exec functionality that is executed from
// within the same context as any executables scheduled.
// A cell must be allocated for every executable scheduled. A cell defines the resource constraints of the system to allocate for an arbitrary use case.

## api/cells/cells.proto
Isolation :
174Â // Default: false
bool isolate_process = 10;
*the value `10` is associated with the field, not the strength of isolation*
// Will isolate the process (and proc filesystem) from the host.
// Will unshare the pid, ipc, uts, and mount namespaces.
// The cgroup namespace is always unshared with the host.
